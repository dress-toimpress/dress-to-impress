## Tips for Safer Use

Maximize safety while enjoying this best dress to impress script by implementing strategic usage patterns. Avoid running auto-win mode at 100% success rate, as perfect winning streaks appear statistically impossible and attract attention. Configure the win rate limiter to 70-85% for natural-looking results that still dominate leaderboards.

The dress to impress script troll features are entertaining but use them sparingly in public lobbies. Excessive trolling generates reports from other players, increasing account risk. Reserve troll mode for private servers with friends or use subtle troll options that add humor without obvious disruption.

Rotate between automated and manual play sessions. The dress to impress cheat script can handle everything, but occasionally playing naturally creates activity patterns that appear human. Mix in some rounds where you disable auto-dress and create outfits manually, even if they don't win.

When using the dress to impress script auto farm overnight, enable the anti-AFK bypass and set reasonable farm duration limits. Farming for 24+ hours continuously creates unusual activity patterns. Better to farm in 4-6 hour blocks with breaks between sessions to simulate natural play habits.

Keep your dress to impress scripts roblox repository up to date. Outdated versions may contain detection vulnerabilities or lack compatibility with recent game updates. Enable GitHub notifications to receive instant alerts about critical security patches or version updates.

Test new features on alternate accounts before using them on your main profile. While this dress to impress script keyless solution includes sophisticated anti-detection, no script guarantees absolute safety. Protect valuable accounts by experimenting with alt accounts first.
